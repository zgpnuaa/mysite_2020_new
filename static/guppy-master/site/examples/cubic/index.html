    <p>Remember the quadratic formula?  It looks something like
    this:</p>

    <p>$fraction(-b+square_root(b^2-4ac), 2a)$</p>

    <p>But that's just some expression.  If you think a little harder,
      you might remember its immediate context and meaning: If you
      have three known quantites $a, b, c$ and some unknown $x$, but
      you know that $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, then you can deduce the value
      of $x$--it is the expression you see above.</p>

    <p>But when does that happen?  Mathematics is always concerned
      with "finding $x$" almost as a game in its own right, but really
      the quest for $x$ most often starts with a real problem.  Maybe
      we want to predict the motion of a canonball.  We intuitively
      know the arc through the air resenbles a parabola, and maybe
      even remember that the quadratic equation above also looks like
      a parabola.  So if we know some physics maybe we can model the
      canonball with a quadratic equation, whereupon this formula will
      let us deduce things about it's trajectory.</p>

    <p>We start with a real-world problem, model it as a mathematical
      one, use mathematics to solve the model, and then interpret the
      results as predictions about the real world.  In the case of the
      canonball, the mathematical model is an equation, and the
      mathematical technology that takes us through the bottom half of
      that picture is the quadratic formula.</p>

    <p>This is not uncommon: An equation simply captures the numerical
      relationships between numbers.  If we can solve equations, that
      simply means that we can deduce numerical consequences from
      these relationships.  Scientific laws are often about
      relationships between measurable quanities--that is, equations.
      Applying scientific laws, then, is about deducing the
      consequences of those relationships in various specific
      situations.  That is, solving equations.  </p>

    <p>The lowly quadratic formula makes a very brash claim, then: Any
      time you have a relationship between numbers that is quadratic,
      a single formula will furnish all the consequences of that
      relationship without exception.  When we happen on something so
      powerful and striking, it is valuable to ask how this came about
      and how far we can push that mechanism to get even more powerful
      results.</p>

    <p>This document will be a journey of thinking deeply about simple
      things.  Broadly, the direction of this journey will be toward
      the generalisation of the quadratic formula to cubic equations:
      $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$.  However, the real goal is an effective
      understanding of equations of this kind, and the technology that
      helps to solve them not just numerically, but in a way that
      gives us a precise understanding of how those solutions depend
      on the situation we were given and change with it.  </p>
    
    <p>We will gently but unapologetically introduce abstractions from
      the field of abstract algebra when useful, and will equally
      unapologetically gloss over others.  By the end, you will have
      exposure to high level ideas from group theory, discrete
      harmonic analysis, and Galois theory.  Those names, however,
      will still more or less be just words, as that's all they ever
      really are.</p>
    
<!--    
    <p>
      You know
    the classic formula: $speed() = fraction(distance(), time())$.  If
    you know how fast you're going, and how long you've been going,
    this lets you find out how far you've gone: $distance() = speed()
      time()$.  </p>

    <p>But speed is rarely constant.  For example, if an object is
    falling, speed is increasing by roughly 10 m/s every second.  So
    in fact $speed() = 10 time()$.  So now $distance = 10 time()^2$.
    But what if we started off with some speed?  Then </p>
-->
    <p>Our goal is to solve the cubic equation $x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d =
      0$ with rational coefficients.  We will start by thinking about
      a simpler case: the quadratic formula.  $x^2 + bx + c = 0$.
      Equivalently, if $x^2 + bx + c = (x-alpha()_1)(x-alpha()_2)$, we
      want an explicit formula for $alpha()_1$ and $alpha()_2$ in
      terms of $b$ and $c$ that uses only elementary operations
      (arithmetic operations and taking roots).  </p>

      <h3>Chapter $x^2 + 1$: Complex Conjugation</h3>
      
    <p>Let's start with an example: $x^2 + 1 = 0$.  We know the
      solutions to this: $i$ and $-i$.  In fact, we know a
      relationship between these two solutions: They are complex
      conjugates of another, which we will denote with a $tau$: $-i =
      tau(i)$.  This is not a coincidence, but a result of the
      following observation: If we have a complex number $alpha()$
      that is a root of this equation: $alpha()^2 + 1 = 0$, then we
      can take complex conjugates of both sides:</p>

    <p>$tau(alpha()^2 + 1) = tau(0)$</p>

    <p>Certainly $tau(0) = 0$, so the right side is easy to simplify.
      But the left side also simplifies: The important point is that
      with complex conjugation, it doesn't matter whether you first
      add two numbers and then conjugate them (like $tau(a+b)$) or
      conjugate them first and then add them (like
      $tau(a)+tau(b)$)--the result is the same: $tau(a+b) =
      tau(a)+tau(b)$.  And similarly for multiplication.</p>

    <p>This property is really quite rare in the world of mathematics:
      $square_root(1) + square_root(4)$ is 3, and not
      $square_root(5)$, $sin(pi())+sin(pi())$ is -2, and not
      $sin(2pi())$ (which is 0), and $1^2 + 2^2 = 5$ and not $3^2$.
      This property is also pretty rare in the real world: If you put
      on your socks and then your shoes, the result will be quite
      different to if you put on your shoes first and then your socks!
      When an operation can be done before or after both addition and
      multiplication with the same result, it is therefore quite
      special.  Such operators are called "homomorphisms" (literally
      "same shape").  </p>

    <p>The fact that $tau()$ is a homomorphism allows us to rewrite
      the equation as </p>

    <p>$tau(alpha())^2 + 1 = 0$</p>
    
    <p>That is, $tau(alpha())$ is also a solution to $x^2 + 1 = 0$!
      This is a very general fact: If we have any polynomial $f(x)$
      with rational coefficients, then $tau(f(alpha())) =
      f(tau(alpha()))$, so if $2+i$ is a root of $f(x)$, then you know
      immediately that so too is $2-i$.</p>
    
    <h3>Chapter $x^2 - 2$: More general conjugation</h3>
    
    <p>Now let's take a different example: $x^2 - 2 = 0$.  Any
      elementary student will tell you the solutions to this are
      $square_root(2)$ and $-square_root(2)$.  However </p>

<p>We start with the $alpha()_1 = sig(alpha())$</p>
